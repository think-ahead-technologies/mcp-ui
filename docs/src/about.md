## About

`mcp-ui` pioneered the concept of interactive UI over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP). When MCP was first introduced, tools could only return plain text responses. MCP-UI took the opportunity to transform how users interact with AI tools by enabling rich, dynamic interfaces delivered seamlessly through the protocol.

What started as an experimental project to bring web UIs to MCP tools has helped shape the ecosystem. The patterns we developed - embedding HTML resources in tool responses, secure sandboxed rendering, and bidirectional communication between UIs and hosts - directly influenced the creation of the [MCP Apps specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps).

Today, `mcp-ui` implements the MCP Apps standard while continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible with UI over MCP. The `@mcp-ui/*` packages provide production-ready SDKs for both servers and clients, making it easy for developers to build interactive experiences for their MCP tools.

## What's Included

- **Client SDK** with React components for rendering tool UIs securely
- **Server SDKs** for TypeScript, Python, and Ruby to create UI resources
- **Documentation and examples** to help you get started quickly
- **Active community** pushing the MCP Apps standard forward
